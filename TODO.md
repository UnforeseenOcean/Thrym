# TODO
1. Implement FILO queue system for notes
2. Improve note detection on the glacier section of Midgard map (currently it malfunctions and keeps hitting right or left side)
3. Implement ways to track which squares are which
4. Better way to handle stacked notes
5. Non-blocking delay for keys (which uses direct Win32 API calls? Maybe?)
