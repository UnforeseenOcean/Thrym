## What?
This single Python script will "play" the game for you, so you have at least one "person" to play against. It's basically a dummy player that will actually put up some semblance of a fight.

The point of this robot is NOT to play the game perfectly, it's just to play it well enough to not feel lonely.

## Why?
I live in a region where this game is really (and I do mean REALLY) not well-known. I often had to wait until midnight just to play with others, even then many will (not "would") have latency issues or will eventually need to leave to do their things, leaving me with nobody to play. This was not good, so I have developed a solution.

## How?
This uses OpenCV to detect the notes and decide which keys to press. It uses various ways to try and optimize the process, such as using LUT (Lookup Table) and using masks to cut away sections that don't require processing.

## Cool, what do I need?
You need the following to use this robot.
1. A full copy of Ragnarock on Steam (PC)
2. (Optional) Additional DLCs to play
3. Another computer or a VR headset on another computer to join the multiplayer match
4. Second copy of Ragnarock on Steam (PC) to run on the computer/headset you'll use to play the game
5. Python libraries: `vidgear, opencv-python, pygetwindow, numpy, pynput, tomlkit`
6. Python 3.11 or newer

## How to use
You do need a small setting change for this to work flawlessly.
- Check "Add to PATH variable" while installing Python 3.11
Then, do this:
1. Open a new command prompt by clicking on the folder path bar (next to the "Previous" arrow menu) and typing `cmd`, then type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - If you get an error about access being denied or a permission issue, launch a separate command prompt with admin privileges, navigate to the folder where the script is, and then try again
2. After all the required libraries are installed, type `python thrym.py` to start it.
3. You can press any key on the splash screen to skip it.
4. Play around with the settings, press V to lower the value, B to increase the value, N to toggle Thrym's key output, and M to toggle between fatigue mode and static mode.
5. Note down the setting you found the most enjoyable, and edit the `thrymConfig.toml` to make it a default, per the instructions inside the config file.
6. Press Z to exit.

## Note
- Using this bot to cheat on the leaderboards will not end well.
- This is strictly for entertainment purposes and must not be used for any other purposes, including but not limited to, fraud and cheating.
- This script uses a lot of CPU processing power. You may need a better processor to run both the game and this script. I used AMD Ryzen 5 5600X for the development and testing rig.
- The author is not responsible for any damages or trouble you may encounter by choosing to use this script.

## A short story based on the development background
It was one of the nights before the Yuletide. A lone poet, whose friends have all but disappeared, was writing a tome. 

A tome, birthed in sorrow and loneliness, that will create an imperfect copy of what his friends used to be -- a jotunn. 

With the power of the snake and Thor's hammer, fueled by the potion made from the Seed of Determination and the gift of Freya, he has brought his creation to life and named the jotunn Thrym. 

The first jotunn created by the tome had five imperfect and flawed eyes, and when he visited the village, he was met with the Viking warriors who challenged him to a battle. 

In this battle, Thrym has shown that even with flawed eyes, the jotunn could fight reasonably well against them, earning him an honorable name. But it was not enough for Thrym. 

Thrym has returned to the poet and requested that he be turned back into the dust, and from this dust, a better warrior be born. 

The poet agreed and went to work. From the dust the first jotunn Thrym has returned to, the second jotunn Thrym was born. 

Thrym now had two eyes, two hands, and six fingers, and was taught a short list of actions to perform. 

Thrym has returned to the village and now awaits any warrior who will challenge him to a battle of drums with arcane powers.
